## Upgrade Docusaurus

To upgrade docusaurus, run:

```bash
yarn upgrade @docusaurus/core@latest @docusaurus/faster@latest @docusaurus/preset-classic@latest @docusaurus/theme-classic@latest @docusaurus/theme-common@latest @docusaurus/module-type-aliases@latest @docusaurus/plugin-rsdoctor@latest @docusaurus/tsconfig@latest @docusaurus/types@latest
```

## Upgrade tdev
After detatching a fork of teaching-dev, it will be necessary to periodically update the core framework.

To update to the lastest version of teaching-dev, run `yarn updateTdev` in the local repository (i.e. the detached fork). Afterwards, check the log for changes to non-tracked files and installable / upgradeable packages.

The update behavior can be customized by editing `updateTdev.config.yaml`. The following excerpt explains how the update behavior is configured:
```yaml
tdevPath: ../teaching-dev # The path to the mainline teaching-dev repository.
expectedTdevBranch: main # The expected branch for the mainline teaching-dev repository. Change this only to update a pre-release or historic branch.
trackedElements: # The elements to be synchronized from the mainline teaching-dev repository to the local repository.
    - src: docusaurus.config.ts # Sync the mainline teaching-dev `docusaurus.config.ts` file...
      dst: docusaurus.config.ts # ...to `docusaurus.config.ts` in the custom repository.
    - src: src/ # Sync the mainline teaching-dev `src/` directory...
      dst: src # ...to `src` in the custom repository (Caution: this will override / delete custom files in the custom `src` repository!)
    # ...
watchedElements: # Log changes to these files (glob patterns) in the mainline teaching-dev repository without modifying local files.
    - .env.example
    # ...
